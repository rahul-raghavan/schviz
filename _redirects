# Netlify Configuration

This is a static site that can be deployed directly to Netlify.

## Deployment Steps

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Connect your GitHub repository to Netlify
3. Set the following build settings:
   - Build command: `echo "Static site - no build required"`
   - Publish directory: `/` (root directory)
4. Deploy!

## Redirect Rules

All routes should serve the main index.html file for proper SPA behavior.
